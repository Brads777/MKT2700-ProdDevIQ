🚀 MKT2700: The 8-Phase Product Lab Setup

Instructor: Brad Scheller • Northeastern University

🏗️ Step 1: Environment Setup

Google Drive: Install Google Drive for Desktop. Extract your project ZIP into your G: Drive.

Claude Code: \* Install: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

Init: Type claude, log in with @northeastern.edu email.

Authorize: Type QU and hit Enter when the terms appear.

MCP Tools:

uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-server

claude mcp add perplexity

📂 Step 2: Launching a Phase

Open your terminal, cd into your project folder on the G: Drive, and type claude. To begin a phase, simply tell the AI:

"Read skills/SKILL_Strategic_Foundation_V3.md and begin Phase 1."

Note: The AI is now proactive. Once it reads the file, it will introduce itself and ask for the first set of data—you do not need to prompt it further to start.
