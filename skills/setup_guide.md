🚀 MKT2700: The 8-Phase Product Lab Setup

Instructor: Brad Scheller • Northeastern University

🏗️ Step 1: Environment Setup

Google Drive: Install Google Drive for Desktop. Extract your project ZIP into your G: Drive.

Claude Code: \* Install: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

Init: Type claude, log in with @northeastern.edu email.

Authorize: Type QU and hit Enter when the terms appear.

MCP Tools:

uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-server

claude mcp add perplexity

📂 Step 2: Launching a Phase

Open your terminal, cd into your project folder on the G: Drive, and type claude. To begin a phase, simply tell the AI:

"Read skills/SKILL_Strategic_Foundation_V4.md and begin Phase 1."

Note: The AI is proactive. Once it reads the file, it will introduce itself and ask for the first set of data—you do not need to prompt it further to start.
