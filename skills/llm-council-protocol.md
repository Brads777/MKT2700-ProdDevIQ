SKILL - LLM Council Protocol

Purpose

The LLM Council is a structured multi-model evaluation process using Claude and Gemini to reduce bias at critical decision gates.

Council Checkpoints

Phase 2 - Rubric Vetting
Review criteria and weights for structural agreement.

Phase 5 - Concept Scoring
Apply 0-4 scale rubric evaluation. Agreement threshold is ±1 point per criterion.

Phase 6 - KANO Validation
Verify feature classifications against user personas.

Phase 7 - PRD Review
Ensure technical integrity and specification completeness.

Resolution Method

Agree - Both models are within the threshold.

Diverge - Trigger a cross-examination where Claude reviews Gemini's logic and vice-versa.

Gap - Adopt missing insights from the more rigorous analysis.
