The 8-Phase Product Lab

MKT2700: Product Design & Development • Spring 2026
Northeastern University
Instructor: Brad Scheller
Deadline: Sunday, February 15, 2026, 11:59 PM EST

Assignment Overview

Welcome to the Product Lab. Your mission is to operate as a venture-backed product development studio. You will identify a high-potential opportunity, validate it with recursive evidence, and deliver a production-ready Product Requirements Document (PRD).

You will use ProdDevIQ, an AI-augmented pipeline leveraging Claude as your strategic partner and Gemini as an independent evaluator via the LLM Council.

Final Deliverables:

The PRD: A professional 10-section technical specification.

Narrated Video: A 5-10 minute presentation of your journey and vision.

Artifact Logs: Evidence of recursive research for all 8 phases.
